[h1]Description[/h1]

Modules Enhanced is an editor extension that seeks to provide useful new modules to the 3DEN editor as well as potentially fix/recreate broken/inconsistent/outdated vanilla Arma 3 modules.

[h2]Features[/h2]
- Many new modules ranging from ambient artillery and paradropping vehicles to trapping inventories and creating mine jammers.
- Utilizes CBA's event system and per frame handlers.

[h2]Under The Hood[/h2]
- Modules create dependency. All clients must have the mod.
- No scheduled scripts. All code is in unscheduled space using CBA's frame system. This makes sure that code is executed exactly when its needed.
- CBA's event system instead of remoteExec.
- CBA's system allows for easy hooks into this mod. Other mod makers have an easier time adding their mods on top of mine.
